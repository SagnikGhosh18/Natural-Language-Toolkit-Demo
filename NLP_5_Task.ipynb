    "corpus=[\"The sky is a zingy mocktail of orange, peach and pineapple, and the Indian Ocean is awash in shades of cyan and cobalt blue. A flock of white tern, locally called kiru dhooni, is swarming the sea’s surface for fresh catch. The wind and water current pick up pace, shoving the pigeon-sized birds aside, but they persevere against nature’s odds, triumphantly scooping up their day’s hunt. I watch the chase in time for sunset from the overwater hammock of my two-storey villa at Ozen Reserve Bolifushi. Malé’s skyline is visible in the distance, standing as the only proof of civilisation outside the island. My intentions to step out for an evening stroll are put on hold as the scenery tightens its grip on me. The Maldives is a wonderful cliché. A half-hour ride aboard the property’s luxury catamaran from the capital city leads me to my destination in Kaafu Atoll. If first impressions are telling, Ozen Reserve Bolifushi blends island extravaganza and local traditions. The sound of bodu beru drumming and the sight of an aquamarine house reef welcome me to the number 8-shaped island, whose length and breadth I will explore on foot, bicycle and buggies over the next three days.Samir, my hiyani (butler), escorts me to my swanky accommodation perched in seclusion at the tail end of a stilted track. After we drive past sandy labyrinths, restaurants, art and retail shops, private beaches, and villas with pointy, slanting roofs come into view. “Before it became Ozen, in 2020, this place was called Jumeirah,” Samir proffers while revealing that the architecture draws influences from the Arabian belt. It comes as little surprise that the address is widely popular among holidaymakers from the Middle East. A colossal doorway opens to my private ocean reserve that comes equipped with a pool, an outdoor deck, a living space, and a guest room tastefully splashed in tropical fabrics, wood carvings, and sweeping floor-to-ceiling windows. The upper floor leads to the master bedroom, an open terrace, and a slide that curves and drops straight into the lagoon. I could spend hours touring my ostentatious abode, and so, I do exactly that until hunger pangs come knocking in time for dinner. Local nosh takes precedence over Indian flavours on my travels overseas, as it helps me sink my teeth deeper into a region’s culture. However, when an opportunity to dine at Tradition Saffron—the in-house Indian restaurant, whose menu maps the journey of the country’s cuisine—presents itself, I oblige. Pani puri arrives with mint- and tamarind-caviar studding, while a host of spice-infused cocktails accompany different courses of the meal. I begin to demolish the 14-dish seafood-and-meat thali, taking apart the tandoori ajwani prawn, gushtaba, chingri malai, and lamb biryani, among a host of options. Luv, my server, tells me that the spices are sourced from India. To my relief, the heat isn’t muted to cater to the western palate. Guilt seeps in as I struggle to wipe the plate clean. “You don’t have to finish it all. We just want our guests to sample the ultimate Indian-food experience,” Luv’s words are reassuring and I learn that the leftover finds its way to the island’s compost pit. The next morning, my search for Maldivian flavours leads me to the beachfront Vista Del Mar, where I pack in a hearty bento-box breakfast of paper-thin roshi (roti), mashuni (fine mix of tuna, onion, coconut, and chili), traditional fried eggs, and kandu kukulhi (tuna curry). I particularly dig the tongue-tingling chilli that perfumes the mashuni, before noon beckons me for lunch at the sand-floored Sangu Beach and Bar to feast on modern Levantine and Moroccan cuisine, and Ozar—the main bar—where sundowners are enjoyed with live band performances. But it is ORIGINE’s radiance and breeziness that has me floored. Executive chef Chaitanya Raghav Sharma, an Udaipur native who has helmed the resort’s kitchens for six years, joins me for dinner at the overwater French restaurant. Between discussing the flipside of “Instagram-friendly restaurants” and ridiculing the idea of hotels equipping guest rooms with weighing scales, we bite into morsels of the crustacean selection: scallops topped with keta caviar, sous vide Maldivian lobster dressed in tarragon caviar cream, and green apple and celery sorbet. I’m told that the archipelago’s limited landmass and expansive waterbodies are deterrents to large-scale crop cultivation. “Most ingredients barring fish, are imported from Europe and Dubai,” Sharma states matter-of-factly while motioning towards my plate. “That is why it is important to be self-sufficient in every way possible. Chef’s Garden, where we grow our own herbs, was born out of this necessity.” As I polish off dinner, resident sommelier Rohit Suresh draws my attention to Cuvee—the adjoining wine library. One thousand four-hundred and forty bottles of wine and champagne from 24 countries peep from behind glass showcases. “Chateau Margaux 1985 from Bordeaux, in France, is our oldest bottle of wine, and the Château Margaux 1999 is our most expensive bottle at $10,550,” Suresh discloses as we tour the space. I do not bother doing the math. Instead, I retire for the night with my newly imbibed wine wisdom. At ELE | NA spa, massage therapies are ruled by elements of nature. I opt for the jetlag facial treatment, based on metal, considered ideal for detoxifying. The setting is tropically rejuvenating as I make my way past the reception garden and head straight to the overwater therapy room, where a glass-floor patch unveils views of marine life that inhabit the house reef below. Zen is the only emotion that overrides my senses for the next hour, while my therapist puts her marma massage expertise to work. I look into the mirror and feel my face muscles relax. It isn’t much longer until I dash off to my big adventure: a turtle quest. A speedboat whisks me to a reef situated 20 minutes from the property in company of fellow guests. I don’t heed the choppy waters, and wait for the boat to come to a halt. When that happens, I waste no time and jump into the sea with my snorkelling gear on, following the lifeguard as we traverse the reef’s circumference. Corals shaped like pumpkins, cabbage patches, and bouquets decorate the sand bed, and more varieties of fish than I can identify swim past me. It feels like being in a David Attenborough documentary, but the delight of exploring an underwater realm in real time is unrivalled. Forty-five minutes go by, but there is no sign of a turtle. I feel a tinge of disappointment when our lifeguard directs us to get back on the boat. Some things in life boil down to sheer luck. I simply prefer to take my chances.\",\n",
    "       \"Bright, colourful lanterns are strung from timber-frame structures that flank both sides of the alleyways, and a canal zips through the town’s centre. Visiting Hoi An Ancient Town feels like partaking in the Festival of Lights, only on a daily basis. Before it became a tourist magnet in recent years, the quarter in Quang Nam province was once a popular trading port for Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch merchants dealing in silk, ceramics, and spices between the 15th and the 19th centuries. Today, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is a nod to a well-preserved mashup of cultures—local and foreign—which is evident in ornate Cantonese temples, Dutch and French colonial homes, wooden shop houses, and the 17th century-built Japanese Bridge (etched on notes of VND 20,000). Cash in on the opportunity to get custom-made ao dai—traditional Vietnamese apparel—from any of the local tailor shops in only 24 hours or hunker down on tiny red stools and sip on fresh brews by street-corner stalls, there is no wrong choice here. While daytime is charming, an evening stroll through the lanes is downright romantic. Fishermen by dawn and boatmen by noon, such is life for locals in Cam Thanh region, commonly known as Coconut Village. The site, situated merely six kilometres from Hoi An Ancient Town, is widely popular for their offering of the bamboo-basket boat ride. Navigate palm tree-dotted canals on eco-friendly coracles, whilst boatmen entertain by dancing to head-spinning tunes and casting fishing nets in the waters. If you want the complete adrenaline experience, request a dizzying twirl that feels like being caught in a whirlpool. Tipping at the end of the excursion is considered polite. Pho requires no introduction and is slurped by bowlfuls all over Vietnam, but Hoi An is home to regional delicacies such as the delicate, shrimp-stuffed white rose dumplings (banh bao banh vac); onion, turmeric, and coriander tossed chicken rice (com ga hoi an); and thinly sliced soy-simmered pork, herbs, and wide rice noodle mix called cao lau (pronounced gaow laow). Although lotus seed sweet soup infused with water chestnut or litchi (che vai hat sen) isn’t native to the place, it must not be missed. For a set seafood menu that includes specialties such as toasted crayfish bathed in butter and garlic, steamed squid, and sweet-and-sour shell broth, a reservation at Golden Light Restaurant on Hai Ba Trung street is recommended. My Son (pronounced mee saw, meaning “beautiful mountains”) Sanctuary is a portal to the region’s ancient history. A cluster of Hindu temple ruins from 4th and 13th centuries are scattered across the open, tree-lined landscape surrounded by Cat’s Tooth Mountain (Hon Quap). Interestingly, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is the erstwhile capital of the Champa Kingdom of the Cham people, whose spiritual origins were rooted in Hinduism. The windowless structures with a sole east-facing door are made of fired bricks held together with a mixture of resin and a secret ingredient. It is common to sight Shiva statues placed on lingas, and some idols that are missing a head on their shoulders either as a result of being at war with rival kingdoms or from being attached to precious jewels on crowns. Intricate details of Hindu mythology play out in the architecture, while their now-extinct script, which bears close resemblance to Sanskrit, is etched on stones. If this piques your interest, make a pit stop at the Cham Museum in Da Nang, which houses a huge collection of the dynasty’s carefully preserved relics found over 10 centuries. Of Vietnam’s 3,260-kilometre coastline, Da Nang occupies 35 kilometres stretching between Hai Van Pass and Non Nuoc. Base yourself near My Khe Beach and get rewarded with varying landscape views, where blue waters sit in juxtaposition with faraway mountains. Watch the sunrise from the shore, bring out the surfboards and catch the big waves, or grab a delicious banh mi from a nearby food stall and hang back until sunset—time moves at a snail’s place when there’s nowhere else you’d rather be. Make sure to also check out any of the plentiful eateries within walking distance. Predominantly a beach resort city, Da Nang is also famed for some of the country’s most iconic bridges. The 2,185 foot-long Dragon Bridge, opened only in 2013, frames the Han River and has quickly become a favourite among shutterbugs. Come weekends at 9 p.m., the “dragon” breathes fire and water, putting on a spectacular show that is best relished from the rooftop sky bar at Happy Yacht docked near Love Pier. It’d be a shame not to sneak a quick trip to Sun World’s Ba Na Hills, located half an hour west of the city. As you ascend 1,487 metres above sea level in the world’s longest non-stop, single-track cable car ride, at over 19,000 feet in length, swathes of the engulfing Truong Son Mountains come into view and the temperature suddenly plummets by a few degrees once you alight on the amusement park-cum-resort hill station. Be warned, its most famous attraction is also by far its most crowded; walk the 500-foot long Golden Bridge (aka the “Hand Bridge”)—a curving pedestrian bridge that appears to be held up over the world far below by two giant stone hands. The adjoining French Village enchants with a French Gothic-style cathedral, French restaurants, and cobblestoned streets, while an indoor amusement park is a field day for kids. While you’re there, polish off unlimited Vietnamese and European noshes at the two-storey buffet starting at only VND 2,50,000/₹850. Mi Quang, which literally translates to “Quang Noodles”, is a textural tour de force and a true taste of the province. The yellow-tinted flat rice noodles are perfumed with a bed of fresh vegetables and Vietnamese herbs, blended with a small but intense dose of pork or chicken stock. The dish is ubiquitously found on local menus. If it is sea-spread that you’re after, snap up a table at Brilliant Seafood, whose selection of live catch ranges between mantis shrimp, tiger prawn, crab, long-legged spiny lobster, Korean flounder and scallops, among others. The allure of a scenic route mustn’t be lost upon a road tripper in Vietnam. At the confluence of Da Nang in Quang Nam province and Lang Co in Thua Thien Hue province, lies the 21-kilometre stretch of Hai Van Pass. The mountain road snakes and climbs up to 500 metres above sea level and runs in tandem with the ocean and white sand strips of Lang Co village below. En route to the city of Hue, you’ll encounter open fields and the cloud-mirroring, 800-hectare brackish water of Lap An Lagoon—a sleepy fishing village and a popular spot for weekend getaways from Da Nang. The landscape needs to be seen to be believed. For centuries, Hue prevailed as a political stronghold in the region and was also the seat of the Nguyen Dynasty between the 16th and the 20th centuries. Traces of its history are evident even today in moss-coated pagodas and Art Deco mansions with modernisation interjecting in the form of open parks, commercial markets, and traffic-devoid roads. The Imperial City of Hue must not be missed for its fortress and palace, the grandest of its kind in the country, spanning 10 kilometres in circumference. At Khai Dinh Tomb in Chau Chu mountain, one can see the resting place of Nguyen’s Dynasty’s 12th and last ruler—Emperor Khai Dinh (1885-1925). The complex—which took 11 years to build and was completed in 1931, six years after the king’s death—is modelled on the Chinese philosophy of feng shui, and is adorned with iron, steel, roof tiles, porcelain and collared glass from France, China, and Japan. A stop at the 19th-century Tu Duc tomb on Van Nien Hill provides an insight into Emperor Tu Duc’s life of imperial splendour, which he shared with his 104 wives and many concubines, although he fathered no children. The area is occupied by a pond, pavilions, chambers, courtyards, and a belying “tomb”, where the emperor and his treasures were supposedly buried. The real site is a well-guarded secret, and consequently, all 200 servants who buried Tu Duc were beheaded. The nearby Thuy Xuan incense village is a visual and olfactory overload. The scented incense sticks make for great souvenirs to bring back home. It is no secret that Hue was home to blue bloods, and now, its descendants. The region prides itself on mostly-vegetarian produce—devoured by aristocrats of yore—which featured in royal kitchens, and the traditional eventually made its way into many contemporary cafés. The family-run An Nhien Garden Vegetarian Restaurant & Cafe is a case in point and its ambiance is as refreshing as it is innovative. The garden setting is welcoming with al fresco seating and artworks sprawled on neatly manicured lawns. The indoor space is rather cosy and private. The real winner is the menu, which features only handmade ingredients with the exception of soy sauce. Dig into vegetable-stuffed rice sheet rolls dipped in peanut sauce—a house favourite appetiser—before moving on to the crunchy lotus seed rolls. The intricacy of sesame bamboo salad is topped by the simplicity of lotus seed rice, while chunks of cashews garnish the pineapple rice that comes undone in citrusy glory. But it is the violet rice cakes elevated with a generous drizzle of fish sauce that seals the deal. For a taste of nobility, try the king bean sweet soup, which was exclusively relished by noblemen in the past. Luckily, the region’s palate extends beyond the likes of all-vegetarian fare. Take a ferry ride across the brackish waters of Tam Giang Lagoon in Phong Dien in time for sunset. Fishermen will direct you to unassuming seafood restaurants built on stilts, where the menu takes a lagoon-to-table approach. Fish pancakes along with prawns, crabs, and scallops cultivated in the waters below are freshly cooked and served with a choice of condiments that will leave you licking your fingers clean. There truly is no better way to kick start the day than by setting sail across the Huong River as it slices through the heart of Hue. The waterbody, monikered the Perfume River, flows through myriad forests, collecting sweet-scented orchids along the way in autumn before reaching the city. Watch the region slowly wake up in time for sunrise, but don’t be surprised if you see locals already having plunged in for a cold swim. In Hue, perks of after hours extend beyond the scope of a weekend. Head out to the main district and eat your way through Dong Ba Market before dropping in at Ta Vet Pub (or any of the adjoining bars) in the lively Vo Thi Sau Street for a cold beer that will set you back by VND 18,000/ ₹60. If you’re craving a kick of caffeine instead, sip on salt coffee—a Hue specialty—or the Hanoi invention of the creamy ca phe trung (egg coffee) that are just as sought after here. After all, Vietnam is the world’s largest coffee exporter second only to Brazil.\",\n",
    "        \"“Now I’m a bit rusty, but it’ll be fine,” Lindsay Williams’ voice is raspy from a long night at a karaoke bar, but my guide’s tone is padded with remarkable aplomb. The 50-something, who likes to project his age greater than it really is to induce an element of awe, has been a tour guide with Dreamtime SouthernX Pty Ltd, an Aboriginal-owned tour company, for the last five years. His black fedora gives him a Carlos Santana edge, perhaps a tip of the hat to his two-decade artistic stint in theatres in Melbourne and Sydney before rerouting his career to local tourism. We’re at The Rocks—arguably one of the oldest suburbs in Sydney—home of the First Nations people and the site where European settlers stepped ashore in 1788. The Harbour Bridge frames a dominating view to my left, and the Sydney Opera House sits gracefully across the Sydney Harbour to my right. The precinct’s history lies right underneath its cosmopolitan flair and Williams is about to help me scratch the surface. Modern-day Sydney stands on the traditional Gadi land of Eora Nation, whose original inhabitants include the Gadigal people among other ethnic groups. “In Aboriginal culture, people don’t create languages. The land does,” Williams’ announcement is laced with a hint of native pride as he leads an Aboriginal tour of the neighbourhood. More than 500 different languages, including sign languages, were documented during colonisation, and are believed to have prevailed for tens of thousands of years, he continues. When he converses in his father’s tongue, Gumbaynggirr, a language that honours his saltwater heritage, and his mother’s tongue, Wiradjuri, a language that traces his freshwater heritage, he is speaking with the land and its elements. He plucks a strand of lomandra—a native Australian grass—and hands it to me, asking me to chew off the white stalk base. Curious, I oblige, and discover that it has no flavour, but is succulent. In pre-colonial times, the shoot was often used as a source of fresh water, and the demonstration was a show of how people stayed hydrated through the day. Williams reveals that this plant and the adjacent bush of bright red grevillea, locally called gurugu, are common totems. “Traditionally, when an individual is born in a clan, they’re assigned several totems based on plants, animals, seasons, tribes, families, and gender, which are emblematic of their ancestry,” he explains, disclosing one of his totems: the shark. If an individual is delegated a personal totem at birth, they become tethered to it for life. From that moment on, they must amass all the knowledge about it, care for it like a sibling and ensure that it thrives in its environs. Everything connected to the totem invariably becomes an extended family. The system regulated different elements in the ecosystem and ensured they flourished at all times. The restoration of balance brought on by the sustainable method is partly why the region evaded the clutches of famine. “The only catch is people sharing the same totem are not allowed to marry each other,” he grins. A short walk around the corner brings us face-to-face with Saltwater Harbour, where water the colour of ink stretches to the horizon. In the distance, Williams points at Baramada—the place of the eels—where freshwater meets saltwater. Culturally, clans are divided into two subdivisions owing to the land’s proximity to the coast and the river. “This region was ground zero of colonisation,” he grows serious. When the British came, they compartmentalised the Aboriginal people as nomadic. “We were being classified by those who came from the other side of the planet. What then is the definition of nomadic?” The site of the Sydney Opera House was once a tram shed, and in pre-colonial times, it was occupied by middens—a mountain of oyster shells discarded by the original custodians of the land that later served as an architectural inspiration for the iconic monument. The natives took turns to sample different seafood and left behind fish bones and shells for the next family that stopped by in order to avoid the troubles of overfishing. The purpose of the middens was defeated when the colonisers consumed mud oysters into extinction. “Rock oysters can still be found in the region today and no, they’re not a band”; Williams’ light-heartedness prompts a round of chuckles from his audience. I peer closely and see them glued to the rocky surface in the waters below. It turns out the colonists also needed lime to bind together bricks and stones into structures. So, they crushed the middens from around the Harbour and mixed the remnants with water to make a lime slurry. Today, modern Sydney and Aboriginal Sydney coexist in the architecture, with middens protruding from the brick walls of old buildings lining the stretch of The Rocks Market. Following another bend in the road, we walk under a canopy of lights strung between souvenir shops and arty cafés, arriving at a mural painted upon The Observer Hotel. Artist Michael Lynn’s attempts at tracing the timeline of Australia’s “modernisation”, which is made evident in his work only post 1788, after the arrival of the Europeans, has garnered polarised emotions and views. “He may not have intended it, but it is a fine example of colonialism hiding in plain sight.” According to the ancient philosophy of the Aboriginal people, everything in the world has a place and purpose. Even the criss-cross-patterned bark of the bawlgowli, or cabbage palm trees, which dot the lanes leading to the Harbour Bridge, inspired the design of the region’s traditional hat weaving. “The motif is part of their signature style. My niece is very good at making them,” states Williams. Similarly, wood from the fig tree was used to make fishing spears, while wood from ironbark, dogwood, and Australian hardwood was carved to make kangaroo spears. “While we’re on the subject of tools, I have something for you,” he says, pulling out a pair of boomerangs from his backpack. The first one I hold is the hunting boomerang, rudimentary but weighty, followed by the easier to recognise ‘returning’ boomerang—flat on the bottom and curved on top like an airplane wing—used to frighten birds. It’d zip past the prey, belying the sound of the wind, and cast a shadow that resembled an eagle’s, freezing the birds in terror, buying the hunter just enough time to hurtle the hunting boomerang. He then hands out a batch of lemon myrtle. When out hunting, men would rub the leaf over their bodies to camouflage their human scent. I wonder how many generations have come and gone, each honing and passing down their skills to the next in an attempt to save a part of their heritage from extinction. I glance at Williams, who is busy adjusting his hat. Storytelling is as much tact as it is a tradition. And only some know it best.\", \n",
    "        \"“Cocoa pods are considered fruits,” Dorota Kravčáková’s words fall like music to my ears. Part-time model and full-time chocolatier, the 28-year-old who lovingly goes by Dori, is helming a traditional Swiss chocolate-making workshop at Funky Chocolate Club in Interlaken, a resort town in Switzerland. She holds up the pods—yellowish-orange and creased, sourced from Madagascar—before placing them on the steel table for my group of eager volunteers to inspect. She then brings out a cracked opened one, which reveals dark brown beans inside; the deep colour indicates its maturity. We pass it around the circle, carefully examining its leathery texture and learn about its medicine-rich properties. The only diversion overriding our visual senses is the heady perfume of chocolate that permeates the room. I feel like I just stepped into Tim Burton’s fantastical realm. In this chocolate factory, however, it isn’t Willy Wonka but Tatiana and Vladimir—two chocolate connoisseurs and the brains behind the 2014-established Funky Chocolate Club—who run the circus. At their behest, Dori followed her heart from Slovakia to Switzerland and joined the team in 2017, after completing a three month course at the Chocolate Academy in Zurich. On an average, around 7,000 people signed up for the workshop every year until the pandemic came knocking. While the number of participants has since waned, the experience remains a sweet dose of fun. The place may not feature chocolate rivers, gum drop trees or rock candy mountains, but it certainly lives up to its quirky name. The shop at the entrance arrests my attention. Stacks of pop-coloured beer cans and quirky quotes that scream “beer is cheaper than therapy” line the walls. The adjoining café displays a liquid chocolate churning pot and assortments of fair-trade and organic chocolates that include vegan, dairy, nut and gluten-free varieties. But the real spectacle unravels in the workshops, behind veiled curtains: right where I win my golden ticket. Inside, I gear up for a lesson in chocolate making and its history. Dori walks over to a corner wall plastered with Swiss flags, a world map and a poster advertising fresh cocoa pods from Brazil. They are lighter in tint than their ripe counterparts and the insides are filled with a sticky, sweet, white pulp. Once the cocoa pods are ready to be harvested, the farmers take them down from the trees and cut them open. “The first step to make a chocolate is to get rid of the pulp and dry the cocoa beans,” Dori begins.  The process, similar to drying rice, takes three days. The colour shifts from white to brown, after which it is ready to be shipped to the country of production. When the cocoa arrives at its destination, it is roasted on high temperature à la coffee beans, releasing its alluring aroma and flavour. The beans are then ready to be ground for the next 72 hours, resulting in a smooth, velvety texture, and are mixed with other high-quality ingredients to make fine chocolates. Dori moves over to the world map and quizzes my group, “Where do you think chocolate originated?” “Ghana.” “Nope.” “Madagascar?” “Nope.” “Ecuador!” “It’s Mexico,” she reveals. “The Aztecs and the Mayans were the first in the world to recognise the value of cocoa beans. It was even used as a currency in olden times,” she adds. Before chocolates were moulded into bars, the community held its liquid form in high regard. The humble recipe demanded that the cocoa beans be crushed and mixed with hot water and spices like cinnamon, chillies and vanilla. A drink so revered was reserved only for Gods and members of the royalty. Upon realising its health benefits, it was made accessible to warriors who guzzled it as an energy booster. “It was their version of Red Bull back in the day,” Dori quips. Soon, the rest of the world discovered cocoa. Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador best known for conquering the Aztecs and claiming Mexico on behalf of Spain, brought it to the court of Spanish royalty, who later shared it with the French. During colonisation, the French introduced it in Africa. Today, Ghana and Nigeria are some of the biggest global producers of cocoa even though the plant isn’t native to the continent. Other key players include Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, the Caribbean, Hawaii in the United States, Kochi in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. These regions lie in close proximity to the tropical belt, making it hospitable for cocoa to thrive under specific weather conditions with ample sunshine and heat.\"] "

    "art1 = vect.transform([\"Flanked by the bank of the Mandovi in Goa, Chorão’s thriving mangrove ecosystem is best known as the home of Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary. A former Portuguese settlement, the island’s landscape is marked by unique aqua-agro features known as khazans, which were devised to facilitate the equitable distribution of water as a resource.Often seen drolly floating belly-up in its brackish water bodies, a fuzzy, playful semi-amphibious member of the weasel family, both adored and maligned in equal measure, is known to flourish here. It’s not uncommon, especially in recent years, to discover epithets such as ‘Goa’s best-kept secret’ or ‘otter island’ bestowed upon Chorão. Wild Otters Research, the conservation organisation Borker started in 2018, operates off the island, conducting walks, internship programmes and research-oriented activities, the focus of most of which is the smooth-coated otter. Regardless of whether the wrong kind of interest would be detrimental to the otter population anywhere in the state, he asserts that sightings aren’t really a part of experiencing these animals in the wild.“Otters are very elusive creatures and the usual wildlife tourism model, where sightings carry varying degrees of certainty, isn’t applicable here. Their habitats aren’t easily accessible. If you’re coming with a certain expectation, know that there’s hardly anything significant to see in the conventional sense… Voluntourism, which India is slowly warming up to, is a different proposition.”Although Borker’s no longer a part of Wild Otters Research, the collective organises conservation-focussed activities such as bat crawls and mangrove trails. However, chasing any interaction with the otters entails spending long hours in the field, and investing a week in training: setting up and checking camera traps, getting angles right. “Expect to be only locating otter droppings, initially. We’re very happy when we spot fresh otter poop—it is something that gets us as excited as most people would upon seeing a tiger. It’s important to spend time, a good 20-25 days, for the experience to be immersive, because short-term volunteers (under a week) aren’t of much help. Looking for otter signs is a very specialised skill… you require a week’s training before you can start to contribute. Otherwise you can just tag along and feel that you have contributed, but in reality you haven’t,” Borker, who graduated as an engineer, quips matter-of-factly. Reports of feral dog attacks on the resident otters,a little while ago, suggested the presence of interspecies or even human-wildlife conflict by extension. But Borker feels that such instances are nothing new, only their documentation. What is, however, a concern, is a relatively new trend: that of building steep and straight concrete retaining wallsin the khazans. “These walls have absolutely no consideration for wildlife. When they were built for the first time during Portuguese rule, they were constructed with mud and clay. But over time, they have not been maintained as they were supposed to. Today, the solution to that is concrete retaining walls, and they’re built very straight and steep, which is a hindrance for animals such as otters, who stay at the bank most of the time, where they rest, groom and make their dens. As a result, the habitat gets continually fragmented, even for other species such as crocodiles, for whom access to the bank is crucial. This is something that will actually reduce numbers—the reproduction will go down.” Top Takeaway: If one really wants to make a difference with volunteering, set aside at least two weeks to immerse in habitats that shelter elusive species such as otters. Try to adopt a mindset that goes beyond sightings and places value in understanding behaviour patterns based on the evolving means of documentation and interaction with animals.\"]).toarray()\n",
    "art2 = vect.transform([\"On the 75th anniversary of India’s independence, it’s time to undertake explorations so that communities benefit, traditions thrive, and ecosystems cop as little damage as possible. For NGTI’s July-August print issue, we curated 60 trips for slow, sensible travel across the length and breadth of the country, from staycations rooted in sustainability and run by locals, conservation-centric urban excursions and riveting train journeys to spirited family holidays and flavour trails in bastions both forgotten and fledgling. Glance at a few snippets below. With technological advances, railway travel has become faster, more comfortable and in some cases, far more luxurious. But for those who are interested in knowing exactly how significant this mode of transportation has been in the course of human history, the mountain railways of India are a fantastic way to take a trip back in time. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railways, Nilgiri Mountain Railways and Kalka Shimla Railway, were set up between 1881 and 1908, and are operational to this day. All three routes, aside from being testament to the engineering advancements of their time, have unique characteristics that make these journeys unlike any other. The Darjeeling to New Jalpaiguri route, for instance, is the only mountain railway in the world that passes through no tunnels, affording passengers uninterrupted views of the lower Himalayas in North Bengal. The Shimla to Kalka route passes over the world’s highest multi-arc gallery bridge, a record that is maintained to the day. The Udhagamandalam-Mettupalayam route is the steepest in India, and passes through historic stations such as Coonoor. It’s also one of the few routes  that still issue Edmondson-style manual tickets, a souvenir in itself. Each of these  railway routes can make for an itinerary in themselves, given  the historic towns and cities they connect in the  mountains of India. These awe-inspiring twin karst rock formations that visitors to Gokarna (48 kilometres) can drive to in just over an hour, are said to have been formed millions of years ago. During Shivratri, pilgrims circumambulate the jagged boulders that have been locally named Bhairaveshwara Shikhara and Mohini Shikhara(legend has it that the demon Bhasmasura was vanquished by Vishnu here). The trek (visit once the monsoon is over) up to the rocks is three kilometres long, but those looking for a longer adventure may hike up to Vibhuti waterfall. Before Kolkata ascended the throne as the capital of a British-ruled Bengal, Murshidabad was the crowning glory of the state. The town, founded as Makhsudabad by Akbar in the 16th century, is a seat of descendants of the Nawabs of Bengal, and their presence is seen in landmarks that dot the region. The 1837-built Hazarduari Palace is now a museum that boasts armour, portraits of the Nawabs, and ivory from China. Moti Jhil, the Muradbagh Palace, and the Khushbagh Cemetery are also worth a visit. Interestingly, the town is a draw for handicrafts and sericulture.\"]).toarray()\n",
